# LAMP - SEO Audit Tool 
#### author: Cosmin Alexandru 
version: 0.3.0


### What is LAMP? 
LAMP is a Google Chrome extension made with JavaScript, CSS and HTML. The extension works by injecting JavaScript into the opened webpage so that it may start running some basic operations needed for a SEO Audit.

## SEO Audit Features: 

#### 01 - SCANS the website. 
This first phase will scan the website to extract the content and store it inside objects.

#### 02 - STORING the data. 
On the second phase, the JavaScript code will start storing the data while counting the total number of words, links and images.

#### 03 - CHECKING the data. 
On this phase, the JavaScript code will start checking the word count and character length for the following:
  * page Title 
  * meta Description 
  * webpage text


#### 04 - BUILDING UI/UX 
On this phase, the JavaScript code will start injecting HTML and CSS in build up a user interface for the SEO Audit Tool.

#### 05 - SEO SUGGESTIONS 
After the data has been checked, LAMP will give out a couple of suggestions in order to fix out the SEO, or point out if page title or page description is missing.

## TODO: 
This project will be improved and added in my front-end portfolio.

I plan on adding more features such as:
  * Checking if images have an alt tag
  * Finding the number of internal links
  * And many more
